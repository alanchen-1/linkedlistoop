The original doubly linked list implementation worked fine but didn't work for the purposes of the mini-exercise. I rewrote the implementation with new inheritance structures.
The new implementation is based on the principle that lists are created through a base `empty` list and a `cons` function.

This is a very simple implementation of a doubly linked list in Java.

I did this because during a placement course I took before freshman year, I asked a question about formatting nested if statements. 
The professor led me through implementing this so that he could answer my question.
